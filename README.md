# nxt-sharing-buttons
A very simple social sharing button plugin for WordPress

# Usage
Simply add the shortcode [ssb] to a post / your post template to automatically display some social sharing buttons.
The version 1.0.0 of the plugin does NOT include any styling, so I would recommend styling it via your theme's / child theme's style.css.
